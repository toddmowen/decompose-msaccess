Sorry, not yet ready for day-to-day use!

Current features:
* Decompose and compose MS-Access forms to and from text.

Planned features:
* Decompose other MS-Access objects such as reports, modules,
  queries (should be very easy, similar to forms).
* Decompose tables into two files each: one for schema and one
  for data (more challenging, because unfortunately dumping
  schema to SQL is not an option).
* Decompose other configuration settings needed to reconstruct
  the database, e.g. library references, start-up settings, etc.
